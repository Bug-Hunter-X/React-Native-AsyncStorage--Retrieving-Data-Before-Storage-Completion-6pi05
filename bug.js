This React Native bug manifests when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue is that if you try to access the data before it has completely finished storing asynchronously, you'll encounter unexpected behavior, typically undefined or null values. This is especially problematic if the data retrieval is part of a component's lifecycle method that executes before the storage operation is complete.
