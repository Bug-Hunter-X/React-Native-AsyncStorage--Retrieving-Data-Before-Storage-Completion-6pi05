# React Native AsyncStorage: Retrieving Data Before Storage Completion

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native: attempting to retrieve data before the asynchronous storage operation is finished.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as receiving undefined or null values.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when accessing AsyncStorage data within a component's lifecycle method (like `componentDidMount`) before AsyncStorage's `setItem` operation is complete. Because `setItem` is asynchronous, this can result in the retrieval method receiving an undefined or null value.

## Solution
The solution uses async/await to ensure that the storage operation is complete before attempting to retrieve the data.  This provides a cleaner and more readable solution compared to traditional promise handling.
